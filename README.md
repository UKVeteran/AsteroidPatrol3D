To Do
-----
* nothing much, just MAKE A 3D ASTEROIDS GAME FROM SCRATCH! - ha ha :)
* Add transparent cross-hairs to the middle of the player's screen
* Add large containing laser-grid-cube around game arena, that serves as the game boundaries
* If you cross one of these laser-boundaries, you get instantly teleported to the opposite boundary, just like screen-wrap of the original Asteroids game.
* Add asteroids and UFO saucer that can be shot at (and UFO can shoot back!)
* Add Space-themed background SkyBox (maybe just off-Earth or off-Mars, so we can see a planet in the distance)
* Implement basic collision detection between your/UFO's missiles and Asteroids/UFO 
* Add ability for Asteroids to collide with each other, UFO, and of course your ship
* possibly add physics simulated collision-response, so asteroids can bounce off of each other at correct angles


April 29, 2014 Progress Note
----------------------------

Mobile controls (cell phone, tablet, etc..) are now working properly, allowing for any combination of multiple button presses and simultaneous joystick movements.  I'm really happy with how the mobile interface is turning out!  When you slow-swipe with your finger, the camera looks around your environment in 3D, just like id software's Quake-mouselook!
