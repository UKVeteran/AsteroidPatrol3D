To Do
-----
* nothing much, just MAKE A 3D ASTEROIDS GAME FROM SCRATCH! - ha ha :)
* Add transparent cross-hairs to the middle of the player's screen
* Add large containing cube around game arena, that serves as the game boundaries
* If you cross one of these boundaries, you get instantly teleported to the opposite boundary, just like screen-wrap of the original Asteroids game.
* eventually add asteroids and UFO saucer that can be shot at (and UFO can shoot back!)

----------------------------

Mobile controls (cell phone, tablet, etc..) are now working properly, allowing for any combination of multiple button presses and simultaneous joystick movements.  I'm really happy how the mobile interface is turning out!  When you slow-swipe with your finger, the camera looks around your environment in 3D , just like id software's Quake-mouselook!
